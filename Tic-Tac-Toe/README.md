This is the Tic-Tac-Toe game on the Command Line

Run from Main.main()

On each iteration, players take turns in opening the squares. 

The first one to get three in a row wins

PROGRAMMING NOTES
1. May not be the best OOD ever but it works quite well.
2. The board evaluation algorithm is simple but thought out.
3. The board isn't evaluated as a whole but only the row-col-diag of the last opened square is.
